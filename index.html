    <p>Tsunami waves do not resemble normal undersea currents or sea waves because their wavelength is far longer.[7] Rather than appearing as a breaking wave, a tsunami may instead initially resemble a rapidly rising tide.[8] For this reason, it is often referred to as a tidal wave,[9] although this usage is not favoured by the scientific community because it might give the false impression of a causal relationship between tides and tsunamis.[10] Tsunamis generally consist of a series of waves, with periods ranging from minutes to hours, arriving in a so-called "wave train."[11] Wave heights of tens of metres can be generated by large events. Although the impact of tsunamis is limited to coastal areas, their destructive power can be enormous, and they can affect entire ocean basins. The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami was among the deadliest natural disasters in human history, with at least 230,000 people killed or missing in 14 countries bordering the Indian Ocean.

The Ancient Greek historian Thucydides suggested in his 5th century BC History of the Peloponnesian War that tsunamis were related to submarine earthquakes,[12][13] but the understanding of tsunamis remained slim until the 20th century and much remains unknown. Major areas of current research include determining why some large earthquakes do not generate tsunamis while other smaller ones do; accurately forecasting the passage of tsunamis across the oceans; and forecasting how tsunami waves interact with shorelines.</p>

    <p>Five Nights at Freddy's 4 is an indie point-and-click survival horror video game developed and published by Scott Cawthon. It is the fourth installment of the Five Nights at Freddy's series, and chronologically the first game, making it a possible origin story. It was originally planned for release on October 31, 2015 however the game was pushed forward to August 8, then down to July 23 when it was unexpectedly released on Steam.[1] It was released for Android devices on July 25, 2015, and for iOS devices on August 3, 2015. A Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One port was released on November 29, 2019.[2]

Announced in mid-2015 under the working title Five Nights at Freddy's: The Final Chapter, the game is considered a departure from the previous games, which took place in a security office. Instead, the game takes place in a child's bedroom, placing an emphasis on timing and auditory warnings to complete nights.

Upon release, the game received polarizing reviews from critics; praise centered on its unsettling atmosphere, while others were divided over the game's new mechanics. Five Nights at Freddy's 4 is the only game in the entire series that has no spoken dialogue. The fifth installment, Five Nights at Freddy's: Sister Location, was released on October 7, 2016.</p>
